		<div class="container-n__col-sm-10 container-n__col-md-8 flex-center">Squirrel Attack is a card board game about squirrels, inventions and business models. The game combines competitive and collaborative game play and here follows more about it.</div>
		<div class="container-n__col-sm-10 container-n__col-md-8 flex-center">Long Story - Long</div>
		<div class="container-n__col-sm-10 container-n__col-md-8 flex-center">SA famous professor had been secretively doing tests aimed at enhancing human capabilities. He had been experimenting with artificially enhanced vision, embedded skeletons, genetically modified organs etc. All tests were done on squirrels. And as you might guess quite a few squirrels died in the process. Funny enough it turns out squirrels have believed the very professor was their Squirrel God.</div>
		<div class="container-n__col-sm-10 container-n__col-md-8 flex-center">So when the Global Council of Squirrels found out about the experiments they weren't exactly thrilled. The professor didn't live up to their expectations... literally.</div>
		<div class="container-n__col-sm-10 container-n__col-md-8 flex-center">Squirrel Attacks surged across the globe. The severity of those has been increasing daily. Now humans are blocked at their homes - everybody hoping that squirrels won't find a way in.</div>
		<div class="container-n__col-sm-10 container-n__col-md-8 flex-center">There is a way out for humanity, though. The Global Council of Squirrels have chosen you along a small group of other inventors to bring human technological and societal advancements to the squirrel society. Each of you will partner with a small team of squirrels in the process.</div>
		<div class="container-n__col-sm-10 container-n__col-md-8 flex-center">You have one month to improve squirrel lives and save humankind. The best one among you will become the New Squirrel God. Are you ready?</div>
